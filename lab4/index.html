			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> The purpose of this lab was to pseudocode a computer game.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> I didnt really have any problems. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> I learned that pseudocoding is an outline for problem-solving. It helps to break down tasks and be organized before coding.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> 
						<pre><code>
							// Have each player pick their three choices (rock, paper, or scissors)
								// Player 1 selects their input from the 3 choices
								// Player 2 selects their input from the 3 choices
							// Both inputs are compared, and a winner is chosen
							// The winning player’s score increases by 1
								// Retrieve winning players score
								// Add 1 to winning players score
							// The updated score count for both players is shown
							// Game resets
								// (Restarts from the beginning)
							</pre></code>
