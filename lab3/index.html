			<h1>₊ ⊹ Lab 3 - File Structure and File Transfer ₊ ⊹</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The purpose of this lab was to create a local file structure on my computer, add index.html files and upload to the server.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I didnt have any problems creating a local file structure because I installed a template(from modes). I did have a hard time with my image on the homepage because I didnt upload it correctly but once I did, it appeared on my homepage.  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> This assignment was not too hard, I just edited what I already had.  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> This is the index.html I edited and this is my file structure: </p>
					<img src="img/file.jpg">
